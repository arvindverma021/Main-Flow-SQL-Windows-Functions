SQL Window Functions for Student Performance Analysis

Objective:
The goal of this project is to use SQL window functions to analyze student performance by:

Ranking students based on their TotalScore.
Calculating running totals of MathScore to track cumulative performance.
Steps Involved:
Dataset Setup:

Create a Students table with columns: StudentID, Name, MathScore, and TotalScore.
Populate it with sample data.
Tasks to Perform:

Task 1: Rank Students → Use RANK() OVER (ORDER BY TotalScore DESC).
Task 2: Running Total of Math Scores → Use SUM(MathScore) OVER (ORDER BY StudentID).
Execution & Validation:

Execute SQL queries and check if results align with expectations.



Insights into Student Performance Based on Scores and Cumulative Analysis ::
1. Ranking Analysis (Total Score-Based Ranking)
The student with the highest TotalScore ranks first, while students with the same TotalScore share the same rank.
If a tie occurs, the ranking skips the next number (e.g., if two students are ranked 2nd, the next student will be ranked 4th instead of 3rd).
This analysis helps in identifying top performers and understanding how scores are distributed.
2. Cumulative Analysis (Running Total of Math Scores)
The running total of MathScore increases progressively as we move down the list.
This analysis is useful for tracking performance trends and identifying patterns in student scores.
It can be helpful for teachers or administrators to see whether students are improving in a particular subject over time.
3. Key Observations:
✅ Top Performers: Students with the highest TotalScore can be recognized for awards or scholarships.
✅ Consistency Check: If a student has a high TotalScore but a low MathScore, they might be excelling in other subjects.
✅ Cumulative Performance Monitoring: Running totals help track progress and improvements in Math scores.# Main-Flow-SQL-Windows-Functions
